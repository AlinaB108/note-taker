## Description
Note Taker allows users to write and save notes for organization and task tracking (e.g for small businesses). Note Traker is a full-stack app which uses Express.js to save and retrieve notes from a JSON file.

A list of existing notes appears on the left side of the screen. When a note title is clicked, the full note text appears in a text field on the right side.

A Save icon appears at the top of the screen when a new note's title and text have been entered.

The notes are written to a JSON file which make them accessible when the page is refreshed and/or opened on another computer.
